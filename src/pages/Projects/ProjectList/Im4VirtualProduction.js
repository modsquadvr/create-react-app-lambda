      <Typography paragraph>
        Calosoma retusum reaches about 25–32 millimetres (0.98–1.26 in) in length. This species usually has a bright metallic dark green or bronze green coloration, sometime with bluish reflections. The borders of the pronotum are rounded and raised. Elytra are striated, with large punctures. These beetles are voracious consumer of caterpillars, so they are considered beneficial insects for the agriculture.
